// Array.from() converts holes to undefined

// forEach(), filter(), every() and some() ignore holes.

// map() skips but preserves holes.
console.log(5, arr.map(x => x + 'AA'))

// entries(), keys(), values() treat each hole as if it was the element undefined.

// With regard to holes in Arrays, the only rule is now that there are no rules.
// Therefore, you should avoid holes if you can (they affect performance negatively, too).
// If you canâ€™t then refer to the table in this article.
